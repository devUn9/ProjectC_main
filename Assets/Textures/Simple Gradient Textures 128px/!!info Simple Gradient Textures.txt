1. About
________

This pack provides a complete set of simple, lightweight gradient textures for various visual effects or other graphical purposes.

As a bonus, 5 solid textures with varying lightness levels are also included for any place you need a flat texture.



2. Naming system
________________

The filenames work this way:

Gradient_(Type)_(Number).png

Types:
BtT = Black to Transparent
BtW = Black to White
WtT = White to Transparent

Number:
1,2,3	 	Linear
4,5 		Rectangular
6,7,8,9 	Spherical
10,11,12 	Radial



3. Tips & tricks
________________

-There are many things that can be done using these seemingly basic textures. Some examples include camera masks/filters, fog, backgrounds, screen effects, heightmaps, scenery, special effects and more.

-Aside from game development, the pack is just as usable in other applications, since its a set of 2D textures in .png format, which is universally usable everywhere.

-You may notice that the preview in the inspector inside Unity fails to show .png images with alpha transparency properly (Unity v4.1), which causes the black to transparent textures appear completely black, while the white to transparent are completely white. Don't worry, the textures themselves are completely fine and work normally when applied to a material that supports transparency. You may also check the textures in the file explorer to see that they are indeed fine.

-For the above reason, I've provided a help sheet to see every texture listed with its name displayed, so you can get around the issue with the preview window.
